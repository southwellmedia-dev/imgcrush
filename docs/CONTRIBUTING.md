## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces for all props and complex objects
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Use proper type annotations for function parameters and returns

**Example:**
```typescript
interface ImageCardProps {
  image: ProcessedImage;
  onRemove: () => void;
  onRegenerate?: () => void;
}

export function ImageCard({ image, onRemove, onRegenerate }: ImageCardProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `useCallback` and `useMemo` for optimization
- Clean up effects properly (return cleanup functions)
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

**Example:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  // Use url...

  // Cleanup
  return () => URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}, [blob]);
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Use Mantine components for UI elements
- Keep styles consistent with existing design system
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings (unless interpolating)
- Add trailing commas in multi-line arrays/objects
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

### Git Commit Messages

Follow semantic commit message format:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add AVIF format support
fix: resolve memory leak in image processing
docs: update README with new features
refactor: simplify preset selector component
```

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Image Format

1. Update the format type in `src/types/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   format: 'jpeg' | 'png' | 'webp' | 'avif'
   ```

2. Update format validation in `src/processing/processors/FormatProcessor.ts`

3. Test thoroughly across browsers

4. Update documentation

### Adding a New Compression Preset

1. Edit `src/presets/compressionPresets.ts`
2. Add new preset to `COMPRESSION_PRESETS` array:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'my-preset',
     name: 'My Preset',
     description: 'Description of what this preset does',
     icon: 'ðŸŽ¯',
     settings: {
       quality: 0.85,
       format: 'webp',
       // ... other settings
     },
     recommended: ['Use case 1', 'Use case 2']
   }
   ```

3. Test the preset with various images

### Adding a New Processor

1. Create new processor file in `src/processing/processors/`
2. Implement the `Processor` interface:
   ```typescript
   import { Processor, ProcessingContext } from '../types';

   export class MyProcessor implements Processor {
     name = 'MyProcessor';

     isEnabled(settings: ProcessingSettings): boolean {
       // Return true if this processor should run
     }

     async process(context: ProcessingContext): Promise<ProcessingContext> {
       // Process the image
       return context;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Register in `ProcessingPipeline.ts` constructor

4. Add relevant settings to `ProcessingSettings` interface

## Testing

> **Note:** Testing framework is being set up. This section will be updated when Vitest is configured.

When tests are available:
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for processing pipeline
- Test edge cases (very large images, invalid inputs, etc.)
- Aim for good coverage of critical paths

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Include code comments for complex logic

**JSDoc Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates target dimensions based on resize mode and settings
 * @param originalWidth - Original image width in pixels
 * @param originalHeight - Original image height in pixels
 * @param settings - Processing settings including resize mode
 * @returns Object containing calculated width and height
 */
export function calculateDimensions(
  originalWidth: number,
  originalHeight: number,
  settings: ProcessingSettings
): { width: number; height: number }
```

## Performance Considerations

- Test with large images (10MB+)
- Test batch processing with many images (50+)
- Monitor memory usage (use browser dev tools)
- Ensure Canvas objects are properly cleaned up
- Use Web Workers for heavy processing (future enhancement)

## Browser Testing

Before submitting a PR with UI changes, test in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest) - especially for WebP support
- Edge (latest)

## Accessibility

- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Add proper ARIA labels to buttons and interactive elements
- Test with screen readers when possible
- Maintain good color contrast ratios
- Ensure focus states are visible

## Questions?

- Open a GitHub Discussion
- Comment on relevant issues
